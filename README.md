# Gears

Matlab functions that aid the design of gear pairs and introduces the surprisingly beautifully math behind simple mechanical gears. The code generates the shape of the gears based on the build parameters like adendum size, number of teeth, radius, etc..
It generates a certain kind of gear called involute gears which turned out to have a beautiful math behind it!

![Screenshoot 2](/doc/img2.png?raw=true "Sample image 2")
![Screenshoot 3](/doc/img3.png?raw=true "Gear measurements")


## Instructions

1 - Configure and run either gear_test.m or compute_animation_parameters.m 

1.1 - [optional] configure and run gear_test.m to see what some measurements in the gear means

## TODO

for compute_animation_parameters.m, the distance to the gears must be tuned
